1.Installed Nmap :

2.Found my local IP range from cmd by typing a command in cmd(command prompt) ipconfig (XXX.XXX.X.XX) :

3.Run: nmap -sS XXX.XXX.X.XX to perform TCP SYN scan :
  
  Nmap scan report for YATHI3108.bbrouter (XXX.XXX.X.XX)
  Host is up (0.00063s latency).

4.Noted down ip addresses and open ports found.:
 
  PORT      STATE SERVICE       VERSION
  135/tcp   open  msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC
  139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn   Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
  445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds?
  2179/tcp  open  vmrdp?
  5432/tcp  open  postgresql    PostgreSQL DB 9.6.0 or later
  16992/tcp open  http          Intel Active Management Technology User Notification Service httpd 12.0.95.2489

5.Researched common services running on those ports :
   
  Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows, cpe:/h:intel:active_management_technology:12.0.95.2489

6.Identified potential security risks from open ports :
  
  TCP Sequence Prediction: Difficulty=258 (Good luck!) there is no risk found!



OBJECTIVES:Learnt to discover open ports on device in my local network to understand network exposure.
TOOLS USED : Nmap.

OUTCOME: Basic network reconnaissance skills,understanding network service exposure


                                                                           
                                                                      "FINAL OUTPUT"
